          <p><strong>Carson</strong> is the remaining heir to a once-powerful crime family, and he wants out. As soon as his little sister turns 18, they run away to start a new life together. But as soon as they leave city limits, Carson is held hostage by an outlander cult. Now, he must escape both the cult and Mother and find his way back to civilization to reuinite with his sister.</p>
          <p><strong>Laeneth</strong> is recovering from an attack that gifted her several nearly-detached limbs and a brand new anxiety disorder. Sick of feeling powerless, she jumps on the chance to stop a mugging. Turns out, the 'mugger' was trying to steal information for Mother â€” damning information about the same experimental procedure that saved Laeneth's life. In return for her silence, a biotech mogul offers Laeneth the fame she craves, but a friend warns her that the mogul can't be trusted.</p>
          <p>Despite being strangers, Carson and Laeneth share a secret: both are carriers of Erasure, an infection that decimated the US population almost a century prior. Luckily for them, this strain is supposed to be harmless.</p>
