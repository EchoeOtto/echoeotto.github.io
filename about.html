    <h1>Echoe Otto</h1>
    <p>Echoe spends way too much time making up stories â€” whether it's writing books, designing and programming videogames, or just improvising dialogue while watching her kitties slap each other in their fluffy faces.</p>
    <p>She holds a dual degree in English and Computer Science from Westmont College, and currently works as a university web developer.</p>
    <p>When she's not bringing code or characters to life, Echoe enjoys listening to rock music, baking scones, and figuring out how to cram more mods into her favorite role-playing games.</p>
